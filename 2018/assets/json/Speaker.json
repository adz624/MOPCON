Renewable energy usually causes unstable power supply, so it is necessary to ensure that additional power is available or the operating reserve can be deployed. Blockchain or so-called decentralized ledger technology has been introduced into the electric vehicle system to help balance the grid through specific algorithms without compromising the usability of the customer's electric vehicle battery. The presentation will talk about the software construction behind the smart electric grid and let the participants know the recent development progress.","characters":"","slide":"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/1gvXqA4LmxZPSx0AifKWsYkCB1kIjypNuIN4h97xmoto\/edit#slide=id.p","picture_merged":"","video_record":""},{"speaker_id":"26","schedule_id":"20","name":"\u9673\u4fca\u8afa","name_en":"Lance Chen","company":"KKBOX","job":"Senior Software Engineer","info":"\u5728 KKBOX \u64d4\u4efb\u8cc7\u6df1\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e2b\uff0c\u8ca0\u8cac\u8a2d\u8a08\u548c\u958b\u767c\u6280\u8853\u67b6\u69cb\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u5728\u958b\u653e\u5e73\u53f0\u5718\u968a\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u6280\u8853\u89e3\u6c7a\u65b9\u6848\u8b93\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u5408\u4f5c\u5925\u4f34\u6574\u5408 KKBOX \u670d\u52d9\u5230\u5404\u7a2e\u7522\u54c1\u4e2d","info_en":"Lance works in KKBOX as a senior engineer, responsible for designing and devoping the technical framework and structure.

The major differences between the data of mobile application and the data of the traditional application system lies in: 1. The variance of data structure is huge with lots of unstructured data. With the development of the technology and new application, more types of front-end facility will be launched. 2. Location-relevant data has to be deal with which that the mobile application have to be adjusted with the locations. The system need to sense the location of the event and trigger different response. 3. It needs to process bigger character sets to fit new frontend application such as emoji and other growing character space. MySQL is growing with IoT, and has become the most widely deployed open source dataset with the highest level of function and usability. It further support JSON document, and can operate JSON document through XDevAPI using CRUD, which is non-SQL and JSON originated. Also it has more comprehensive GIS function and support utf8mb4 character and become the best choice for both traditional information system and mobile application system.
