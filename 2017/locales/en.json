  "spirit_slogan_2": "Before the term \" Web 2.0 \" came up ten years ago, there has been a term called \" Hyperconnectivity \", which describes the impact made by the more closely connected relationship between people as well as the interconnection with faster communication between people and machine. Nowadays, Web 3.0 is advancing and growing in full force with Iot and Cloud Computing. Besides the rapidly growing online services and the development of smart devices, the invention of technology like Big Data, Artificial Intelligence(AI) and Virtual Reality(VR) are dramatically changing the way people interact with each other, and with machine. Therefore, we decide to rethink and discuss the meaning of \"Mobile Open Platform.\"",
